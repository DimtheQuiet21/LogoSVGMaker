## Description 
This project accepts user input and generates simple SVG logos. One of three shapes may be chosen (square, circle, or triangle) and up to three letters may be placed in the logo. Also, text color and fill color of the logo may be chosen from the primary colors.

## Installation

The following NPM modules must be installed in the integrated terminal with Node.js installed (don't forget to place them in the .gitignore file)

    npm install
    npm i inquirer
    npm i jest

## Usage Information
Anyone may use this project to generate their own logos

## Testing Instructions

To test the application, in the command line, type the following command:
    
    "npm test"

Follow the prompts just as if you were making a normal logo. Do this three times.
You should see three passes if everything is functioning appropriately.
